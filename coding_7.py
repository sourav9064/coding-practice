##Consider the below series:
##1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17â€¦..
##
##This series is a mixture of 2 series fail
##the odd terms in this series form a Fibonacci series and
##all the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order
##
##Write a program to find the Nth term in this series
##
##The value N in a positive integer that should be read from mm.
##The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT
##Otherthan the value of Nth term ,
##no other characters / string or message should be written to STDOUT.
##
##For example, when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17
##So only the value 17 should be printed to STDOUT
